# Support
The Open Source Starter Kits are not a Cisco Product and as such all support is offered on a best efforts basis directly by the contributors of the Starter Kit directly.

Please do not raise a support request with Cisco or Cisco Spark for Developers for any issues relating to the Starter Kits as they will be unable to assist, they will request that you raise the issue against the third party repository.

To request support raise an issue against the repository for the respective Starter Kit.
