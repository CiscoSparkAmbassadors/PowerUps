## Best Practice

We recommend following the considerations.

- Use a UUID as the Bot address for anonymity
- [Restrict the Bot to a specific room](https://developer.ciscospark.com/webhooks-explained.html)
- Make the Bot only respond to specific email domain or Cisco Spark organisation, you can see an [example](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/readme-ciscospark.md#controller-options) of this here using the Botkit framework
- Use a long, randomly generated Secret to encrypt the Webhook payload (some frameworks will handle this for you)
